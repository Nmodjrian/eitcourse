# Introduction

## The origins of the course

::: {.fragment}

### "If only I was told this ealier in my career"

Imagine a workflow that enabled:

- Fewer context switches
- More focus on *the content* and not style of the work
- Integration of code into your research manuscript
- Automatic generation of results, including figures and tables...
  - That can be changed seamlessly when input datasets or code changes
- Control over how you export and publish your work
  - Including publication-quality PDFs, your own website, blogs, slides
- Full reproducibility
- You to share your work for maximum benefit to others
