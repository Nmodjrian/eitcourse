However, most of this knowledge has accrued for hospital and specialty services and services in rural areas.

	abstract = {Ecosystem services are fundamental to the well-being and health of people. Despite the growing awareness of the positive impacts of ecosystem services on human health, researchers have often ignored many ecosystem functions that are disadvantageous to humans. These negative facets of ecosystems are called ecosystem dis­ services. The central focus of this study was to test the applicability of Geographic Information Systems-based spatial accessibility analysis in mapping the potential risk of ecosystem disservice at a national scale. We used tick exposure as an example of a disservice. Worldwide, ticks (genus Ixodes) are the primary vectors of several dangerous diseases which pose threats to people. As the probability of encountering infectious ticks has increased during the last decades, new spatial information on high-risk tick exposure areas are needed. To evaluate exposure risk, we developed a tick probability map based on tick observations and environmental variables in Finland. First, we analyzed what kind of threat ticks pose to populations in residential areas and around freetime residences. Second, we studied if the movement of people (here school children) in the everyday envi­ ronment increased tick exposure risk. We calculated the shortest school route for all children by using spatial accessibility analysis. Our results showed that taking the movement of people into consideration through the accessibility analysis, we can get a more realistic picture of tick exposure risk. Further, we gained a better overview of the number of children at higher exposure risk. This kind of information is crucial for pre-assessment and identification of public health strategies for control and minimizing tick-borne diseases. In general, the accessibility approach provided a good overview of areas where the greatest tick exposure was present and produced valuable information to support decision-making. The method enabled new insights into the assess­ ment of exposure to ecosystem disservices.},

This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and ﬁnd that it negatively aﬀects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be ampliﬁed by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.},

	abstract = {Transportation systems can be conceptualized as an instrument of connecting people and their activities over the territory, playing an important role in developing sustainable cities. The current rationale of transport provision is based on population demand and rarely considers the potential of minimizing spatial disparities and uneven distribution of services. To meet the challenge of supporting a more equitable resources distribution, this work aims at identifying and describing patterns of urban services supply, their accessibility, and household income. By using a multidimensional approach, the spatial inequalities of a large city of the global south reveal that the low-income population has low access mainly to hospitals and cultural centers. A low-income group presents an intermediate level of accessibility to public schools and sports centers, evidencing the diverse condition of citizens in the peripheries. These complex outcomes generated by the interaction of land use and public transportation emphasize the importance of comprehensive methodological approaches to support decisions of urban projects, plans and programs. Reducing spatial inequalities, especially providing services for deprived groups, is fundamental to promote the sustainable use of resources and optimize the daily commuting. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The increase in average distance from home to secondary school over recent decades has been accompanied by a signiﬁcant growth in the proportion of pupils travelling to school by motorized means as opposed to walking or cycling. More recently this switch in travel mode has received considerable attention as declining levels of physical activity, growing car dependence and the childhood obesity “crisis” have pushed concerns about the health of future generations up the public health agenda, particularly in the U.S., but also in the UK and Europe. This has led to a proliferation of international studies researching a variety of individual, school and spatial characteristics associated with children's active travel to school which has been targeted by some governments as a potential silver bullet to reverse the trend. However, to date national pupil census data, which comprises annual data on all English pupils, including a mode of travel to school variable, has been under-utilised in the analysis of how pupils commute to school. Furthermore, methodologically, the grouped nature of the data with pupils clustered within both schools and residential neighbourhoods has often been ignored - an omission which can have considerable consequences for the statistical estimation of the model. The research presented here seeks to address both of these points by analysing pupil census data on all 26,709 secondary pupils (aged 11–16) who attended schools in Shefﬁeld, UK during the 2009–10 school year. Individual pupil data is grouped within school, and neighbourhood, within a cross-classiﬁed multilevel model of active versus motorised modes of commuting to school. The results support the ﬁndings of other research that distance to school is key, but suggest that sociospatial clustering within neighbourhoods and schools is also critical. A further ﬁnding is that distance to school varies signiﬁcantly by ethnicity, with white British pupils travelling the shortest distance of all ethnic groups. The implications of these ﬁndings for education and transport policy are discussed.},

It is usually cited as a major selling point for new housing developments in Singapore. This paper explores the relationship between accessibility to prestigious schools and the value of housing properties using a hedonic housing price model based on data drawn from the sales records of individual housing transactions in Singapore for 4 years from 2000 to 2003. While traditional hedonic analyses have employed straight-line distance measurements to focal points such as the Central Business District, as an indicator of accessibility, this study employs accessibility measurements computed for zones where the properties are located. The ﬁndings indicate that the accessibility to prestigious schools does affect residential property price, and it signiﬁcantly explains the variation in housing prices in Singapore. However, these are not valued as highly as other attributes, such as neighborhood prestige and tenure of the property. Sensitivity studies of housing prices show that the extent of the inﬂuence varies with distances to the Central Business District, school enrollment, and performance ranking.},

While more complex measures are gradually gaining popularity with increasing data and computational resources, policy makers and planners are still prone to opt for less complex methods that are easy to use and interpret. The cumulative opportunities measure is the most widely applied accessibility measure in planning practice, but it is also among the least accurate due to its lack of consideration of the impact of competition for those opportunities. This study seeks to highlight the impact of addressing competition for diﬀerent urban services in the cumulative opportunities measure. A competition component is added to the measure, which is applied to a case study of three types of urban services in the Perth metropolitan area; jobs, primary/secondary education and shopping. The results show that considering competition changes the spatial patterns of accessibility and its equity. Since this approach reveals demand-supply imbalances, it can more accurately determine spatial inequalities in accessibility, and hence increases the utility of the cumulative opportunities measure. We also ﬁnd that the three services had varying levels and spatial patterns of accessibility and spatial equity, thus relying on any single one of them for assessing spatial structural performance can be misleading.},

Although the spatial attribute of housing data is generally considered when constructing a hedonic price model, only a few studies investigated the spatial heterogeneity of educational capitalization in depth. To ﬁll this gap, this study uses the housing data of 516 communities in Hangzhou, as well as constructs the hedonic price, spatial econometric and geographically weighted models to quantitatively evaluate the capitalization eﬀect of educational facilities and explore whether space plays an important role in the capitalization of education. Results conﬁrm that, from the perspective of educational quality or accessibility, kindergarten, primary school, junior high school, senior high school, and university signiﬁcantly aﬀect housing prices. Speciﬁcally, the quality of primary school and junior high school as well as the accessibility of university profoundly inﬂuence housing prices. The geographically weighted regression model (GWR) further reveals the existence of spatial heterogeneity in educational capitalization. Diﬀerent types of educational facilities show signiﬁcant spatial diﬀerences in the scope of inﬂuence and capitalization rate, thereby implying that homebuyers have diﬀerent preferences for educational resources in diﬀerent areas of the city. Comparisons of the three models aﬃrm that the spatial econometric model can better handle problems caused by the spatial dependence of housing price, whereas the GWR has unique advantages in dealing with spatial heterogeneity and can obtain results that are substantially detailed.},

A schematic framework shows that mismatches between a calculated indicator and perceptions can stem from inaccuracies in awareness as well as from inaccuracies in the measure if the measure fails to take account of the subjective evaluations of accessibility components. When evaluating the performance of land-use and transport system configurations, calculated measures based on spatial and transport data only serve as proxies for how accessibility is actually experienced. This paper argues that bringing perceived accessibility to the fore of accessibility-based planning, by acknowledging and evaluating potential mismatches with calculated accessibility indicators, will advance the evolution from mobility-based to accessibility-based planning.},

Nevertheless, its use by practitioners is generally limited. The goal of this study is to explore the challenges and opportunities experienced by land use and transportation practitioners to use accessibility metrics in their work. In order to achieve this objective, a survey on the use of accessibility metrics was conducted among 343 practitioners around the world. Findings from the survey show a gap between knowledge of the concept of accessibility and its use by land use and transportation practitioners. While 90\% of the respondents are familiar with the concept, only 55\% stated that they use accessibility metrics in their work. Whereas lack of support and interest does not appear to be a major obstacle to using accessibility metrics, lack of knowledge and data are highlighted as the main barriers to the use of metrics in practice. These results suggest that further training and collaboration is required to support the use of metrics by practitioners. Furthermore, including clear accessibility indicators in planning documents is key to promoting the use of metrics in policy and practice, as it was stated as a main reason motivating the generation of accessibility metrics. This research highlights potential avenues to support the integration of accessibility metrics in practice and is of relevance to researchers, planners and policy-makers wishing to foster accessibility-based planning approaches.},

	abstract = {Inequality in transport provision is an area of growing concern among transport professionals, as it results in low-income individuals travelling at lower speeds while covering smaller distances. Accessibility, the ease of reaching destinations, may hold the key in correcting these inequalities through providing a means to evaluate land use and transport interventions. This article examines the relationship between accessibility and commute duration for low-income individuals compared to the higher-income, in three major Canadian metropolitan regions, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver using separate multilevel mixed effects statistical models for car and public transport commuters. Accessibility measures are generated for jobs and workers both at the origin (home) and the destination (place of work) to account for the impact of competing labor and firms. Our models show that the impacts of accessibility on commute duration are present and in many cases stronger for low-income individuals than for higher income groups. The results suggest that low-income individuals have more to gain (in terms of reduced commute time) from increased accessibility to low-income jobs at the origin and to workers at the destination. Similarly, they also have more to lose from increased accessibility to low-income workers at the origin and to low-income jobs at the destination, which are proxies for increased competition. Policies targeting improvements in accessibility to jobs, especially low-income ones, by car and public transport while managing the presence of competition can serve to bridge the inequality gap that exists in commuting behavior.},

Positionality implies that the utility of a good depends on how the good is distributed amongst the population. In this case: the appreciation of a certain level of accessibility or mobility depends on the level of accessibility or mobility of others. The paper explains why this could be the case, provides theoretical un­ derpinnings for it, and discusses options for future research.},

	abstract = {Active travel (walking and cycling) is increasingly being recognised as a potentially effective means of increasing physical activity levels and thereby contribute to physical and mental health. Research related to active travel typically either focuses on the determinants of active travel or its health effects. As far as the authors are aware, no studies have tried to include both sets of variables in a single empirical model. The goal of this study is to address this gap by developing and estimating a structural equation model including both spatial determinants of active travel and relevant physical and mental health outcomes. The model is estimated using aggregated data from all Dutch municipalities, 355 in total. The results indicate that the walking and cycling modal shares are consistently negatively associated with the prevalence of obesity and diabetes and positively correlated with overall physical activity. The effects are similar in size as those of sport participation. The results provide insights as to which spatial characteristics municipalities should focus on if their aim is to increase public health via active travel.},

	abstract = {Several works have addressed the impact of transport accessibility on regional development. Nevertheless, it is not consensual that new levels of accessibility lead to the improvement of regional development. This article proposes a methodological approach to assess whether significant relationship exist between these two variables. The methodology uses Data Envelopment Analysis to evaluate regional performance and spatial statistics methods (local bivariate relationships) to evaluate the type of relationships between accessibility and perfor­ mance for each region, along with its significance. The approach was applied to 186 NUTS that cover 19 Eu­ ropean countries, extending previous works which focus on global results, in the sense that only one (usually large) area is considered. Results indicate that approximately half the regions have a significant relationship between transport accessibility and regional performance. Logit regression analyses show that central regions are more likely to exhibit significance, as well as regions with high (low) levels of performance surrounded by re­ gions with high (low) levels of accessibility, hinting at a synergy between the two variables. An important policy implication is that regions of high performance surrounded by regions of low accessibility may benefit from investments in the transport infrastructure.},

	abstract = {This study advances the methodology of transit accessibility, particularly the cumulative opportunities by including the spatial distribution of accessible opportu­ nities to assess the performance of transit systems and networks in meeting diverse travel needs. In cities where both population and employment are growing in suburban areas, a process of dispersion occurs distributing employment and other activities to centres outside the city centre. This growth causes significant change and diversification in people's travel patterns and needs. As the role of public transport systems becomes increasingly complex, transit accessibility models must address urban sprawl and the change of urban form from monocentric to polycentric. This study characterises the spatial distribution by the degree of clustering (or dispersion) of accessible opportunities, which is then included in the transit accessibility measure. This new accessibility component could be a meaningful indicator for transit agencies and planners to assess the performance of multi-destination transit networks. The transit accessibility measure incorporates a new transit connectivity index to consider that attractiveness of opportunities deteriorates with decreasing route directness and service frequency and increasing travel time. The proposed measure is applied to the transit network in Brisbane, Australia. The results of the accessibility analysis are compared with and without the dispersion factor to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The growing distance between the activities human carry out has naturally been at the root of such phenomena. Efficient transport systems and high travel speeds have enabled access to ever distant opportunities. On the flip side, such conditions have reduced the need for proximity, which in turn has led to a distancing between human activities and to greater car dependency.},
